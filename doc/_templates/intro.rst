TACA code structure
===================

TACA uses `click`_ for building a structured CLI application. So for further details,
please refer to click documentation.

The structure that we have decided to follow for this repository is to create a
``cli.py`` file on each subcommand (submodule) in order to better isolate CLI methods
and thus ease the maintenance. In order to add a new subcommand you should also
create a new ``entry_point`` in ``setup.py``. If you have further questions, don't
hesitate on opening an issue and tag it with the ``question`` tag.

TACA configuration
==================

Mainly, TACA requires a `YAML`_ configuration file to function. This is required,
and whenever you invoke TACA it will look for it. The order is:

1. ``-c | --config`` command line option
2. Environment variable ``TACA_CONFIG``
3. ~/.taca/taca.yaml

If none of these are found, TACA will exit with an error message.

This is how the configuration file should look like:

.. code-block:: yaml

        log_file: /path/where/to/store/the/log/file
